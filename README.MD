# Groceries Receipt Parser
This project started in order to answer a simple question - where is my money going to? 
A lot of my money is going to the grocery store, but this is like a huge block hole. 
I wanted to understand, for example, how much I'm spending on fruits or on cheese.
This will allows me to understand where I should spend less, and save money.
Also, if I noticed that on a specific month we spending more on groceries, I want to understand why - for example, new born that needs a lot of baby food or diapers.
So I decided to try and solve this problem for me, and hopefully also for others.

## Usages
* Install [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr)
* Use tesseract to convert the receipt into a txt file
* Run the parser in this repo with the txt file (`dotnet run kabala.txt`). It should be able to create a list of products from the txt file and print it. I've tested it only with Shufersal receipts.

## Next steps
This is where I need your help! Play with it, open issues, let me know what's not working.
See the open issues for the things I'm planning to do when I'll have some time.
Feel free to contribute code, any help is highly appreciated :)
